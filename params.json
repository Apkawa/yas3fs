No relation whatsoever exists between this project and my employer.**\r\n\r\n* It allows to mount an S3 bucket (or a part of it, if you specify a path) as a local folder.\r\n* It works on Linux and Mac OS X.\r\n* For maximum speed all data read from S3 is cached in memory locally on the node.\r\n* It can be used on more than one node to create a \"shared\" file system (i.e. a yas3fs \"cluster\").\r\n* [SNS](http://aws.amazon.com/sns/) notifications are used to update other nodes in the cluster that something has changed on S3 and they need to invalidate their cache.\r\n* Notifications can be listened using HTTP or [SQS](http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) endpoints.\r\n* With buffering enabled (the default) files can be accessed during the download from S3 (e.g. for streaming).\r\n* If the cache grows to its maximum size, the less recently accessed files are removed.\r\n* AWS credentials can be passed using AWS\\_ACCESS\\_KEY\\_ID and AWS\\_SECRET\\_ACCESS\\_KEY environmental variables.\r\n* In an [EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance a [IAM](http://aws.amazon.com/iam/) role can be used to give access to S3/SNS/SQS resources.\r\n* It is written in Python (2.6) using [boto](https://github.com/boto/boto) and [fusepy](https://github.com/terencehonles/fusepy).\r\n\r\nOn EC2 the command line doesn't need any information on the actual server and can easily be used\r\nwithin an [Auto Scaling](http://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/) group.\r\n\r\nTo mount an S3 bucket without using SNS (i.e. for a single node):\r\n\r\n    yas3fs.py /path/to/mount --url=s3://bucket/path \r\n\r\nTo persist file system metadata such as attr/xattr yas3fs is using S3 User Metadata.\r\nTo mount an S3 bucket without actually writing metadata in it,\r\ne.g. because it is a bucket you mainly use as a repository and not as a file system,\r\nyou can use the `--no-metadata` option.\r\n\r\nTo mount an S3 bucket using SNS and listening to an SQS endpoint:\r\n\r\n    yas3fs.py /path/to/mount --url=s3://bucket/path --topic TOPIC-ARN --new-queue\r\n\r\nTo mount an S3 bucket using SNS and listening to an HTTP endpoint (on EC2):\r\n\r\n    yas3fs.py /path/to/mount --url=s3://bucket/path --topic TOPIC-ARN --ec2-hostname --port N\r\n\r\nOn EC2 the security group must allow inbound traffic from SNS on the selected port.\r\n\r\nI strongly suggest to start yas3fs for the first time with the `-d` (debug) option, to see if there is any error.\r\nWhen everything works it can be interrupted (with `^C`) and restarted to run in background\r\n(it's the default with no `-d` / `-f` options).\r\n\r\n### Quick Installation\r\n\r\nIf you want to do a quick test here's the installation procedure depending on the OS flavor (Linux or Mac):\r\n\r\n* Create an S3 bucket in the AWS region you prefer.\r\n* You don't need to create anything in the bucket as the initial path (if any) is created by the tool on the first mount.\r\n* If you want to use an existing S3 bucket you can use the `--no-metadata` option to not use user metadata to persist file system attr/xattr.\r\n* Create an SNS topic in the same region as the S3 bucket and write down the full topic ARN (you need it to run the tool if more than one client is connected to the same bucket/path).\r\n* Create a IAM Role that gives access to the S3 and SNS/SQS resources you need or pass the AWS credentials to the tool using environmental variables (see `-h`).\r\n* I used the `eu-west-1` region in my sample, but you can replace that with any region you want. If no region is specified it defaults to `us-east-1`.\r\n\r\n**On EC2 with Amazon Linux 2012.09**\r\n\r\n    sudo yum -y install fuse fuse-libs\r\n    sudo easy_install pip\r\n    sudo pip install

print debug information (implies '-f')\r\n\r\n### Notification Syntax & Use\r\n\r\nYou can use the SNS topic for other purposes than keeping the cache of the nodes in sync.\r\nThose are some sample use cases:\r\n\r\n* You can listen to the SNS topic to be updated on changes on S3 (if done through yas3fs).\r\n* You can publish on the SNS topic to manage the overall \"cluster\" of yas3fs nodes.\r\n\r\nThe SNS notification syntax is based on [JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)](http://www.json.org):\r\n\r\n    [ \"node_id\", \"action\", ... ]\r\n\r\nThe following `action`(s) are currently implemented:\r\n\r\n* `mkdir` (new directory): `[ \"node_id\", \"mkdir\", \"path\" ]`\r\n* `rmdir` (remove directory): `[ \"node_id\", \"rmdir\", \"path\" ]`\r\n* `mknod` (new empty file): `[ \"node_id\", \"mknod\", \"path\" ]`\r\n* `unlink` (remove file): `[ \"node_id\", \"unlink\", \"path\" ]`\r\n* `symlink` (new symbolic link): `[ \"node_id\", \"symlink\", \"path\" ]`\r\n* `rename` (rename file or directory): `[ \"node_id\", \"rename\", \"old_path\", \"new_path\" ]`\r\n* `flush` (updated file): `[ \"node_id\", \"flush\", \"path\", \"new_md5\" ]` (`path` and `new_md5` are optional)\r\n* `md` (updated metadata, e.g. attr/xattr): `[ \"node_id\", \"md\", \"path\", \"metadata_name\" ]`\r\n* `reset` (reset cache): `[ \"node_id\", \"reset\" ]`\r\n* `cache` (change cache config): `[ \"node_id\", \"cache\" , \"entries\" or \"size\", new_value ]`\r\n* `buffer` (change buffer config): `[ \"node_id\", \"buffer\", \"size\", new_value ]`\r\n* `prefetch` (change prefetch config): `[ \"node_id\", \"prefetch\", \"on\" or \"off\" ]`\r\n* `url` (change S3 url): `[ \"node_id\", \"url\", \"s3://BUCKET/PATH\" ]`\r\n\r\nEvery node will listen to notifications coming from a `node_id` different from its own id.\r\nAs an example, if you want to reset the cache of all the nodes in a yas3fs cluster,\r\nyou can send the following notification to the SNS topic (assuming there is no node with id equal to `all`):\r\n\r\n    [ \"all\", \"reset\" ]\r\n\r\nTo send the notification tou can use the SNS web console.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, if you uploaded a new file (or updated an old one) directly on S3 \r\nyou can invalidate the caches of all the nodes in the yas3fs cluster for that `path` sending this SNS notification:\r\n\r\n    [ \"all\", \"flush\", \"path\" ]\r\n\r\nThe `path` is the relative path of the file system (`/` corresponding to the mount point)\r\nand doesn't include any S3 path (i.e. prefix) as given in the `--url` option.\r\n\r\nTo change the size of the cache on all nodes, e.g. to bring it from 1GB (the current default) to 10GB,\r\nyou can publish (the size is in MB as in the corresponding command line option):\r\n\r\n    [ \"all\", \"cache\", \"size\", 10240 ]\r\n\r\nTo change the buffer size used to download the content (and make it available for reads) from the default of 10MB (optimized for a full download speed) to 256KB (optimized for a streaming service) you can use (the size is in KB, as in the corresponding command line option):\r\n\r\n    [ \"all\", \"buffer\", \"size\", 256 ]\r\n\r\nSimilarly, to activate download prefetch on all nodes you can use:\r\n\r\n    [ \"all\", \"prefetch\", \"on\" ]\r\n\r\nYou can even change dinamically the S3 URL (i.e. the bucket and/or the path prefix) that are mounted:\r\n\r\n    [ \"all\", \"url\", \"s3://BUCKET/PATH\" ]\r\n\r\nHappy File Sharing!\r\n","name":"Yas3fs","tagline":"Yet Another S3-backed File System"}
